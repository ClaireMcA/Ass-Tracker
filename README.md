#### The Early Plans
Right from the start I was keen to create an assignment planner. For a planner, i think it is important that you can visualise the assignment due dates on a calendar, so i knew it would be important to find the right calendar to work with.

I began with determining what inputs I would need for the database, by thinking about what information you might need to know about each assignment. I decided on:
- Subject
- Assignment Name
- Due Date
- Weighting
- Completion Progress of the Assignment

Once I knew the data inputs and I had found my [calendar](https://codepen.io/nijin39/pen/JbQBXM), I created the index page first, as well as the footer and header templates. This let me determine what links would be in my navigation bar and start to look at how the calendar works. 

From there I began with the 'Create' section of the site, so that I had data in my database I could work with. This then allowed me to start attempting to display the data on the calendar
